# Predicting_Crime_SENG474
SENG474 group project

PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND OVERVIEW
--------------------------------
Predicting what category of crime is likely to happen in Greater Victoria (Victoria, Esquimalt, Saanich, and Oak Bay).

With many crimes happening in Greater Victoria each month, it can be hard to identify where in Greater Victoria it happens in and what category of crime the crime falls into. With this project, we hope to give policy makers and police additional research when assisting the public. We also hope to inform the public about particular crimes that happen in certain times of the day, week, month, and year, so the public can better prepare themselves against crime.
